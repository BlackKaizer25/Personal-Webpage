                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Daniel Kurt Leonardo, and I'm a second-year IT student with a passion for athletics, big bikes, and road trips.
                    As an athlete back in my senior high school, I learned the value of hard work, determination, and teamwork.<br><br>

                    These same skills have carried over into my studies and my love of riding motorcycles.

                    As an IT student, I've always been fascinated by the power of technology and the ways it can be used to solve problems and make the world a better place.
                    Whether it's designing software, building websites, or analyzing data, I'm always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.<br><br>

                    But when I'm not studying or working on projects, I love to hit the open road on my motorcycle.
                    There's nothing quite like the thrill of riding a big bike, feeling the wind in your face, and exploring new destinations.
                    I've been on road trips all over the country, from the mountains to the coast, and I'm always looking for new adventures and new experiences.<br><br>

                    Overall, I'm someone who loves to push myself to new heights, whether it's in the classroom, on the field, or on the road.
                    With hard work, determination, and a positive attitude, I know that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
